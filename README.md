# ~ is where the â™¥ is

## install

  1. `git clone git@github.com:pmeinhardt/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
  2. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
  3. `rake install`

The install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your
home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`,
though.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `bash/bashrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.

For configurations you wouldn't want to see in a public repository, `~/.localrc` is the place to keep them.
