# Colors

If you're looking for a way to create color schemes for use with your terminal,
vim, chrome devtools, and more, I recommend you check out @chriskempson's
[Base16 builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder).

It generates color schemes for your different tools, comes with nice presets
to get you started and allows you to customize them.
